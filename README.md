## Background ##
This project was assigned by the EDX Data Analytics Bootcamp program.
The main aim was to analyze a pharmaceutical company's anti-cancer medication data. The study consisted of 249 mice identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with different drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

## Methods ##
Data were originally saved as csv files, which were imported into Jupyter Notebook. The analysis and final outputs were also carried out in the Notebook (saved as an ipynb file named "main").
